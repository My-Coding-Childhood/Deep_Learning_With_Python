# Deep_Learning_With_Python

I was opportuned to be selected for the Biological Data Science Workshop 2022. This workshop was organized be Drexel University, Rowan University, and the University of Chicago from August 16 to 18th. It was from this workshop that I learnt how to apply deep learning to biology. 
The organizers of this workshop had received permission to use the datasets from the original authors. They also granted permissions to all attendees to use their datasets.

Having undergone this training, I decided to perform same task for my own development. This has exposed me to the application of Machine Learning to biological data (proteins). The codes used for this practice task is on this repository.
